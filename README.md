## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I studied how to make the background image adaptive and I figured out how to remove the blue background when you press buttons from the phone—é.

```html
<div class="major-news__image"></div>
```
```css
.major-news__image {
    width: 100%;
    height: 0;
    padding-top: 41.09%;
    margin: 0 0 25px 0;
    background: no-repeat center / contain url('/assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg');
}
```
```css
.header__icon {
    display: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    width: 40px;
    height: 17px;
    background: no-repeat center / cover url(./assets/images/icon-menu.svg);
    -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);
}
```
